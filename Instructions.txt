During a hackathon at Garmin Stellenbosch, you and your teammates are experimenting with sonic sensors for
athletic events like shot-put and javelin.You've managed to put together a system that can transmit a
sound signal at the projectile being thrown, and record the return signal that reflects off it.

Attached are the transmitted signal that is used for all projectiles, and the received signals for a shot-put
and a javelin throw. Can you calculate the speed at which each projectile was thrown?

BONUS: Can you estimate how far the sonic sensor was off to the side of the thrower in each case?

To apply, please e-mail your code and your CV to jaco.swart@garmin.com. Your approach, assumptions and
coding excellence will be the most important factors being evaluated.
